The main topics of the course include basic architecture of modern computers, interaction
between computer hardware and software at various levels, and performance evaluation and
metrics. Instruction set design, computer arithmetic is also discussed. Data path and control unit
design for RISC Processors are covered in detail. The laboratory work includes the design and
implementation of a 16-bit RISC CPU using an FPGA development system and VHDL.
